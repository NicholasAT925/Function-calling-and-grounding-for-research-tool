      "    > *\"We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.\"*\n",
      "*   **AI Investment and Ethical Concerns:** Alphabet is investing heavily in AI, which is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. They face ethical, technological, and regulatory challenges related to AI development and use.\n",
      "    > *\"We are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to integrate AI capabilities into our products and services... New and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services.\"*\n",
      "*   **Data Privacy and Security:** Concerns about data privacy and security could harm Alphabet's reputation and deter users from using their services.\n",
      "    > *\"Data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services.\"*\n",
      "*   **Regulatory Landscape:** Alphabet is subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide, particularly in data privacy, competition, and AI, which could harm their business.\n",

      "**Amazon's Key Risks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Competition:** Amazon faces intense competition across various industries and geographies, including physical, e-commerce, and cloud services.\n",
      "    > *\"Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services.\"*\n",
      "*   **International Operations:** Amazon's international operations expose them to risks such as local economic and political conditions, government regulations, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n",
      "    > *\"Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed... Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks...\"*\n",
      "*   **Variability in Retail Business:** Demand for Amazon's products and services can fluctuate significantly, impacting their operations and requiring them to manage inventory and staffing effectively.\n",
      "    > *\"Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary fears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events.\"*\n",
      "*   **Fraudulent Activities of Sellers:** Amazon faces risks related to fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers on its platform, which can harm their business and reputation.\n",
      "    > *\"Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods... When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers.\"*\n",
      "*   **Data Loss and Security Breaches:** Amazon's collection, processing, and storage of large amounts of data make them vulnerable to data loss and security breaches, which could have significant consequences.\n",
      "    > *\"Because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could... adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action... deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation.\"*\n",
      "*   **Government Regulation:** Amazon is subject to evolving government regulations, particularly concerning the internet, e-commerce, and AI, which could harm their business.\n",
      "    > *\"We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell... Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations.\"*\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Focus on Interconnected Experience:** All filings from 2022 to 2025 emphasize the interconnected shopping experience, highlighting the integration of digital and physical channels. For instance, the 2025 10-K states, \"We continued our strategic investments aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds.\" This theme is consistent across the 2024 and 2023 filings as well.\n",
      "*   **Emphasis on Pro Customers:** There's an increasing emphasis on serving professional customers (\"Pros\"). The 2025 filing mentions the acquisition of SRS, a distributor serving professional roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors, indicating a strategic move to expand services for Pros. The 2024 filing also highlights initiatives designed to drive growth with Pros, such as providing a customized online experience and a dedicated sales force.\n",
      "*   **Supply Chain Investments:** All filings highlight ongoing investments in the supply chain to improve delivery speed and reliability. The 2025 filing notes, \"We continue to focus on building best-in-class competitive advantages in our supply chain to be responsive to our customers’ expectations for how, when and where they choose to receive our products and services.\" Similar statements appear in the 2024 and 2023 filings.\n",
      "*   **Sustainability and Human Capital Management:** There's a consistent focus on sustainability and human capital management, organized around three pillars: Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities. The 2025 filing states, \"We view sustainability and human capital management matters through the lens of our business, with an understanding that if we support our associates, our customers, our suppliers, and the communities we serve, we also support our business and create value for our shareholders.\"\n",
      "*   **Expansion and New Stores:** In the 2023 and 2024 filings, Home Depot mentions plans to open new stores. Specifically, the 2024 filing says, \"In fiscal 2023, we initiated a plan to open approximately 80 new stores over a five-year period to address those opportunities.\"\n",
